                i just want you to know that i will miss you and it will be hard not to talk to you. you are the person i look upto when im sad, because i know that i absolutely cannot be sad when i think of you. you are the magic fairy who makes me forget all my problems, you are the one who looks after me even if i forget to. you are an absolutely perfect person, what did i do to even deserve you. you are literally he one person who can make me go all blushing and fast-heart paced in just a matter of seconds. you are the person i dont feel any uncomfortability with, you are the person who actually makes me feel so special. i simply dont imagine my life without you anymore- like i wil wale up and look for texts from you, you have made my life revolve around you, you are my sun, giving me light (fuNny how the moon actually shines beucase of the reflected sunrays)
